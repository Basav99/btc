Abstract
BTC2x Vault is an on-chain structured product engineered to deliver a 2x return on Bitcoin (BTC) deposits if BTC appreciates by 40% or more over a 3-year period. Designed for passive Bitcoin holders, the protocol allocates capital into risk-minimized, yield-generating, and directional components via a multi-layer smart contract vault system. The vault ensures partial capital preservation and deterministic upside through automated epochs, option selling, and futures overlays.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The structured product industry in traditional finance offers risk-reward instruments like autocallables, principal-protected notes, and yield-enhanced products. However, these are not accessible to the DeFi user base, particularly for BTC-denominated holdings. BTC holders have limited access to yield-bearing or fixed-outcome instruments on-chain.
1.2 Objective
BTC2x Vault enables a deterministic yield opportunity using trustless primitives and strategy layering. The protocol aims to offer:
2 BTC payout for every 1 BTC deposited (if BTC rises ≥ 40%)


Capital protection near flat or modestly down BTC


Automated settlement and transparent yield logic



2. Market Analysis
2.1 User Base
Long-term BTC holders


Institutional BTC treasuries


DeFi-native portfolios seeking structured exposure


2.2 Problem Statement
BTC provides no native yield


Options and futures strategies are not retail-friendly


No vault product structures deterministic BTC upside with bounded downside



3. Strategy Architecture
3.1 Capital Allocation
Component
Allocation
Description
Risk-Free Layer
30%
Capital deployed in wBTC lending or BTC staking
Options Engine
40%
Monthly OTM call selling with put protection
Futures Overlay
30%
Long futures/call spreads for directional gain

3.2 Risk Management
Options are structured as spreads to cap risk


Futures are size-limited and rebalanced monthly


Vault protects downside until BTC drops >20%



4. Payoff Structure
BTC2x Vault is structured with a binary payoff cap:
Payout = 2 BTC, if BTC ≥ $147,000 after 3 years (starting at ~$105,000)


Payout = variable (0.3–1.0 BTC), if BTC remains flat or moderately down


BTC Price in 3Y
Vault Return (BTC)
$85,000 (-20%)
~0.30–0.40
$105,000 (flat)
~1.00
$135,000 (+28%)
~1.30
$147,000 (+40%)
2.00
$160,000+
2.20+ (optional cap)


5. Protocol Architecture
5.1 Smart Contract Modules
Vault Core: deposit, withdraw, balance tracking


Epoch Engine: initiates monthly strategy execution


Options Manager: executes sell/buy spread logic


Futures Allocator: opens directional long futures/calls


Oracle Connector: fetches BTC/USD from Chainlink


5.2 Automation
Chainlink Keepers or external executor bots


Monthly epoch rolls and maturity check triggers


Auto-compounding from collected premiums



6. Tokenomics & Fees
No native token at launch


Performance fee on net option/futures profits (e.g. 10%)


Entry/Exit fees optional (0–0.25%) to cover gas and ops



7. Roadmap
Phase
Deliverables
Q2 2025
Smart contract deployment on testnet
Q3 2025
Frontend UI, vault simulation, Chainlink ops
Q4 2025
Mainnet launch (Arbitrum + BTC bridges)
2026+
Multi-asset expansion: ETH2x, stETH2x, ADAx


8. Risk Disclosures
Market risk: vault depends on BTC price behavior


Execution risk: options markets may have liquidity gaps


Oracle risk: reliant on external Chainlink feeds


Smart contract risk: mitigated by audits and testnet coverage



9. Conclusion
BTC2x Vault bridges TradFi’s structured yield strategies with the transparency and composability of DeFi. The product introduces fixed-outcome BTC instruments with protection and automation, creating a new category of BTC-native structured returns for long-term holders.
